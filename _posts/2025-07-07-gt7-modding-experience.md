I recently decided to experiment with Gran Turismo 7 on PlayStation and see how far I could push realism through unofficial tweaks and custom setups. While GT7 doesn't officially support PC mods, there are some community approaches to enhance visuals, force feedback, and cockpit immersion using external hardware and software tricks.

I started by adjusting my motion rig profiles and adding a custom transducer setup. This gave me a much stronger sense of tire slip and road texture, making the car feel much more alive, especially on technical tracks like Suzuka or Nordschleife.

I also experimented with custom filters for my headset lens (using a third-party VR injector on PS Remote Play). While not officially supported, this greatly improved contrast and reduced glare during night races. Combined with tweaks to in-game brightness and color tone, I finally got a more "cinematic" look, closer to how I imagine real GT cars under track lights.

For sound, I used an external DSP to fine-tune engine and transmission noise. GT7 has good sound design by default, but boosting certain mid-high frequencies made downshifts and overrun pops stand out in a much more visceral way.

Finally, I recommend paying attention to force feedback damping and sensitivity. I ended up reducing damping and slightly raising sensitivity to get more immediate steering detail, but this depends on your wheel and preference.

While none of these are "true" game mods in the PC sense, they completely transformed my GT7 experience. If you’re into realism and don’t mind experimenting with hardware or external processing, I highly suggest trying these kinds of custom setups.

My setup for reference:  
Wheel Base: Fanatec DD Pro  
Pedals: Heusinkveld Sprint  
Motion Platform: DOF Reality H3  
Headset: PS VR2 via Remote Play workaround  
Sound System: Custom DSP + Nearfield Monitors
