Hi! I’m Hampus, a hobbyist from Sweden with a passion for creating and sharing cool projects. On this site, I mostly document my own work — whether it’s game projects, mods, or software I’m building. Alongside that, I also post guides and mod releases to help others in the community.

I mainly use Unity and .NET for game development, and Python for software projects. Besides coding, I also share my 3D printing projects and my work painting minifigs and replica statues.

I enjoy experimenting with different creative outlets, always learning new skills along the way. This site is my way of sharing what I create, connecting with others, and hopefully inspiring fellow hobbyists. Feel free to explore, leave feedback, or get in touch if you want to chat!
